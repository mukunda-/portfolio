               Without teachers or books, it was a long few years of
               experimentation, building small apps and games in the worst

               It was around this time I became interested in game-console programming.
               I learned C from resources like cprogramming.com. And I learned about console

               I missed the era of early 90s programming and made up for that here, sort of.
               After installing MS-DOS on my laptop, I proceeded to study x86 architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
               I had a <a href="https://twitter.com/_mukunda/status/1259456079370608640">Pentium 4</a> at the time, which was still a marvel of engineering. I
               learned about its rich pipeline and elaborate instruction set, and then
               wrote some small programs to play with it.

            <p>
               The source code for my x86 projects are unfortunately on a defunct hard drive.
            </p>
            <p>
               One was a 3D renderer written for DOS, with the raster code written in x86
               assembly. Of course I wrote this on DOS, too, in edit.exe, to taste the authentic
               early 90s developer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
               Another project was a falling sand game, called FastSand,
               optimized with x86 assembly.

               The library targets both the GameBoy Advance and the Nintendo DS. Unfortunately due to
               strict licensing restrictions (you are not allowed to run code on the ARM7 co-processor,
               which was where my driver was installed), it could not be used in commercial Nintendo DS
               games.

               fit in 256KB of memory, featuring three levels, action-packed bosses,

               The competition deadline was two months, and I didn't have any time leftover.
            </p>
            <p>
               The first month was spent designing and building <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/snesmod/">SNESMOD</a>,
               an Impulse Tracker-based sound and music engine that rivals commercial legends.
               I used what I learned from making XMSNES and pushed the boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
               SNESMOD supports streaming PCM sounds from the SNES cartridge, all nightmarishly
               on a <a href="https://mukunda.com/stuff/SPCTECH.html">500khz computer</a>.
               Tooling, documentation, and examples were all extremely limited or nil.

               pitched in and did some animation work while I worked on adding all of
               the levels in a complex map editor I built with Visual Basic.

            <h2>XMSNES and #mod_shrine</h2>
            <p>
               Sometime in 2007, I joined #mod_shrine on EsperNet, a fantastic community
               that revolves around the greatness of tracker-based music.
            </p>
            <p>
               I had been fascinated by music and sound drivers for a while, and even tried my
               hand at making some amateur music compositions.
            </p>
            <p>
               I built several module-based music players, and XMSNES was one of them, an
               XM module player for the Super Nintendo and the precursor to SNESMOD.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="page">
            <p>
               Similar to SNESMOD, XMSNES comes with a converter and sound driver that was split
               across the two processors in the SNES. Below shows a test demo of it.

               A brief mention here. With all of my work done on tracker-based
               sound solutions, I built AsFLIT for an individual interested in
               bringing this power to the Flash platform.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               It put the latest Flash standard
               to the test, leveraging the JIT-optimized ActionScript 3 engine to
               mix dynamic PCM channels realtime.

               A tiny marvel of engineering, this is a music player for the NES with
               the capability to combine a mix of NES hardware waveforms alongside
               software-mixed PCM.

               The NES does not have hardware to time PCM playback.
            </p>
               
            <p>Whenever a
               block of code was executed, I needed to keep track of the exact cycle count
               (yes, counting everything manually)
               so I could time the software mixer which outputs a single sample at
               a time.
            </p>
            <p>
               I used an array of dummy instructions to manually insert cycle delays.

               A funny quirk was that the pitch of the sound would change slightly if you played
               samples at high frequencies. The memory page-crossing code was too complex to
               account for, so it made tiny delays in the output stream.

               and directly after I was writing robust Java code, complete with
               proper packaging practices, database work, JavaDoc comments, 
               and safe concurrent programming.
            </p>
            <p>I actually really like how the Java manual is written.</p>

               I was working on creating a new experience for Minecraft players,
               but sadly due to the new legal issues Bukkit faced, I decided to
               put this project on the shelf.

               I haven't written Java in a while, but it is certainly up there
               on likeable languages for me.

               I might be a huge geek, but I have some stories away from the computer, too.
               Construction is my family's trade, and I live in this home that I built
               with my family. The entire thing.

               This wasn't the only home I built either. Around 2008 I finished
               another house much the same in Dallas, Texas. Again, from the grass up.

               This is a picture of about a thousand players in
               World of Warcraft gathering after an amazing virtual fair in 2018,
               the annual Tournament of Ages on Moon Guard. That year was particularly
               special because both factions could talk to each other freely with my
               addon, something completely unthinkable before.

               Just before the release of Battle for Azeroth, I created Cross RP,
               taking advantage of the newly released "Communities" feature to bridge
               the language divide between factions, opening up new venues for cross-faction
               role-play enthusiasts. It had a massive welcoming, with a huge event on
               Argent Dawn-EU being the first to use it.

               Not to boast, but I would credit a lot of Cross RP's viral adoption
               and success to its expert design. Here are some points that were
               bulleted in the source code at the start.

               It's also just plain amazing. I get carried away when it comes to attention to detail.

               A typical implementation would just translate text in the chatbox, but I wanted
               the chat bubbles to be translated too.
            </p>
            <p>
               This is an early shot before I redid the
               communications layer to synchronize translation data with outgoing chat, so the
               translations don't have the short delay shown. Instant and seamless.

               Some months later, Blizzard patched the game and removed the API Cross RP was
               depending on, but they also introduced the Elixir of Tongues, essentially to
               provide the same functionality of Cross RP, all without requiring an addon.
               Thanks Blizzard!

               Although then I spent a month reworking my addon to still be able to transfer
               roleplay character profiles across the faction divide. Basically doing the impossible.
               I'll spare you the details unless you ask, but I essentially built a peer-to-peer
               network, turning some of my userbase into routers to pass data where it needs to go.

               I've written <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/tammymg/projects">multiple popular addons</a>
               that their users simply cannot live without, as well as numerous smaller modifications
               to assist players through raiding encounters. I can really appreciate platforms
               and games that offer this flexibility for developers like myself.

               I was the #1 survival hunter in the
               world for a few days during Emerald Nightmare mythic progression. It was one
               of the hardest specializations to play, but I designed an incredible
               UI to compensate.
