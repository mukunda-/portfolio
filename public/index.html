         Without teachers or books, it was a lot of experimentation, making
         small apps and games in the worst way imaginable, but we all started
         somewhere, right?
      </p>

         Eventually I would connect with other developers on the world wide web,

         In 2003, after finishing several small games, I had created Jetpack 4,
         which was a four-player (via split-screen and gamepads) sidescroller
         with open-ended gameplay. Fly around, blow stuff up, build, and hurt
         each other. It was developed in Visual Basic using DirectDraw for

      <h2>An Adventure Into Assembly</h2>
      <p>
         Around this time I started gaining an unhealthy fascination with
         writing assembly language. The tiny binary sizes were just so cool.
      </p>
      <p>
         By now I've seen a lot of different flavors, including Z80, 6502,
         65816, 68K, SPC-700, ARM, and x86. Those are 8-bit, 16-bit, and
         32-bit+ computers.
      </p>
   </section>

      <p>
         In 2007, I installed MS-DOS on my 
         <a href="https://twitter.com/_mukunda/status/1259456079370608640">
            Pentium 4 laptop
         </a>
         and then proceeded to write C and x86 assembly in edit.exe (to taste
         the authentic early 90s developer experience).
      </p>
      <p>
         The source code for my x86 projects are unfortunately on a defunct
         hard drive, but one project was a 3D renderer for DOS with an
         assembly-optimized rasterizer (complete with perspective correction!).

         It wasn't long before I learned that the incredible engineering behind

         <a href="https://blog.mukunda.com/what-amazes-you/">
            basically useless</a>.

         The above example is running on the Nintendo DS. It features taking

      <h2>Bringing it to Flash</h2>
      <p>
         After noting my work done on tracker-based sound solutions,
         <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnHaugeland">@StoneCypher</a> contracted
         me to build something for the Flash platform, a means to deliver great
         soundtracks at a fraction of the bandwidth.
      </p>
      <p>
         I put the latest Flash technology to the test, leveraging the new
         JIT-optimized ActionScript 3 engine and their audio API to mix dynamic
         PCM channels realtime, one of the first projects to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
         It's too bad that Flash didn't live much longer.

         I've had my fair share of fun making the Nintendo Entertainment System
         do very strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below is a recording of
         <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/supernsf">SuperNSF</a>,
         a crazy audio driver I wrote that has the ability to combine
         software-mixed PCM and NES hardware waveforms (which is quite
         difficult).
      </p>
      <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOq9Icu2GQs?enablejsapi=1"
         id="yt_supernsf"
         class="youtube"
         frameborder="0"
         allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"

      </iframe>
   </section>
   <section>
      <p>
         The NES does not have hardware to time PCM playback. All it has is one
         register that you can manually feed a single sample to.
      </p>
      <p>
         For each block of code in the SuperNSF driver, I needed to keep track
         of the exact cycle count (yes, counting everything manually) so I could
         time the software mixer which outputs a single sample at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
         For example (and forgive me for not remembering exact numbers), the NES
         has a 1.79 MHz computer. Divide that speed by 10,000 for a 10KHz
         sampling rate, and you have 179 cycles to mix PCM channels, output a
         single sample, and then process the music sequence. A few uncounted
         cycles means a pitch shift in the output.
      </p>
      <p>
         I used an array of no-op instructions to manually insert cycle delays
         and line everything up.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <p>
         I'm impressed that most emulators are cycle-accurate and support
         SuperNSF.
      </p>
      <p>
         Any slight inaccuracy in emulation would result in massive pitch
         shifts.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2>PCMNSF</h2>
      <p>
         SuperNSF was based off of some previous tinkering I did with @tumult
         from #mod_shrine called
         <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/pcmnsf">PCMNSF</a>, which was a
         simpler 4-channel MOD player.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2>#mod_shrine</h2>
      <p>
         Sometime in 2006, I joined #mod_shrine on EsperNet, a fantastic
         community that revolves around the greatness of tracker-based music.
      </p>
      <p>
         I had been fascinated by music and sound drivers for a while and even
         tried my hand at making music compositions myself.
      </p>
      <p>
         #mod_shrine regularly hosts one-hour music competitions, even today,
         where people create music for an hour using a given sample set and
         then listen together. I did around 350 of these some ten years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
         These guys have been a big part of my life, and if you're one of them
         reading this, you're awesome! We've made music, games, and amazing
         tools together.

         A less abusive tool I wrote was

         MML (music macro language) techniques to create unique instrument
         sounds while providing a tracker-friendly method for composition.
      </p>
      <p>
         The PC side of things generates samples that emulate the final sound
         from the NES driver which musicians can use to compose their track
         easily.

      <p>
         The precursor to it2nsf,
         <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/s3m2nsf">s3m2nsf</a> is a simpler
         version that supports basic waveforms and allows tracker fans to easily
         write music that plays on the NES.
      </p>
      <p>
         The conversion app was coded by the amazing
         <a href="https://twitter.com/reduzio">@reduz</a>, a member of the
         #mod_shrine community. I wrote the 6502-based S3M player in assembly
         code.

         The 1st place winner of PDRoms competition #4.01. I'm proud to be one
         of very few developers to create a complete Super Nintendo game from
         scratch. Everything is written in assembly language.
      </p>
      <p>
         I found out recently that someone even wrote a

         complete original soundtrack</a> composed by

         The competition deadline was two months, and I didn't have any time
         leftover.
      </p>
      <p>
         The first month was spent designing and building
         <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/snesmod/">SNESMOD</a>, an Impulse
         Tracker-based sound and music engine that rivals commercial legends. I
         used what I learned from making XMSNES (described below) and pushed the
         boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
         SNESMOD supports streaming PCM sounds from the SNES cartridge, all
         nightmarishly implemented
         on a <a href="https://mukunda.com/stuff/SPCTECH.html">500khz computer</a>.
          Tooling, documentation, and examples were all extremely limited
         or nil.

         The game had stickmen graphics all the way until the last week before
         the deadline, but <a href="https://twitter.com/codatrigger">@coda</a>
         pitched in and did some animation work while I worked on adding all of
         the levels in a complex map editor I built with Visual Basic.

      <h2>XMSNES</h2>
      <p>
         XMSNES is an XM module player for the Super Nintendo and the precursor
         to SNESMOD. What better way to get into SNES programming than writing
         the hardest things possible?
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <p>
         Similar to SNESMOD, XMSNES comes with a converter and sound driver that
         was split across the two processors in the SNES.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below shows a test demo of it, something that required me to rewrite a
         hardware cartridge hundreds of times (and stick it in the console, and
         boot it, and test via looking at those byte outputs on-screen) to track
         some of the bugs during development.
      </p>
      <p>
         The joys of programming, right?

      <h2>A Fancy Application</h2>

         This year, for one of the communities I'm a part of, I designed an

      <h2>Google Groups Discord Integration</h2>
      <p>
         A notable mention of a tiny project. How to integrate Google Groups
         with something, when Google Groups doesn't have any flexible
         notifications API? Simple, I added my webserver as a subscriber, and
         then parsed the emails that it received, forwarding a formatted sent
         subscribed my webserver While I was at it, I wrote a bunch of other
         neat integrations, like linking Google Groups to Discord (by parsing) a
         handful of Python to integrate Google Groups with Discord
         And why make it simple? This thing uses a JavaScript and
         Google Apps Script backend to generate Google Documents from the input
         and then notify our Discord when an application is submitted or modified.
         This year, I felt like Google Forms looked rather primitive, so I
         had some fun with implementing my own solution. It used a JavaScript and HTML
         frontend

         Just before the release of Battle for Azeroth, I created Cross RP,

         role-play enthusiasts.

         A typical implementation would just translate text in the chatbox, but
         I wanted the chat bubbles to be translated too.

      <p>
         This is an early video before I redid the communications layer to
         synchronize translation data with outgoing chat, so the translations
         don't have the short delay shown. Instant and seamless.

      <h2>It's Part of the Game Now</h2>

         Some months after the release, Blizzard changed the API Cross RP was
         depending on, permanently breaking it.
         <a href="https://youtu.be/o7i6np8ExCY?t=462">They stated</a> that it
         was an unfortunate side effect of addressing security concerns and then
         introduced the
         <a href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Elixir_of_Tongues">Elixir of
         Tongues</a> to compensate, essentially providing Cross RP's

         I'll spare you the details unless you ask, but I essentially built a
         peer-to-peer network and protocol, turning some of my userbase into
