         My first line of code was a conditional statement for a Fahrenheit to

         In 2003, after finishing several small games, I had created Jetpack 4,

         I missed the era of early 90s programming and made up for that here, sort of.
         After installing MS-DOS on my laptop, I proceeded to study x86 architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
         I had a <a href="https://twitter.com/_mukunda/status/1259456079370608640">Pentium 4</a>
         at the time, and I
         learned about its rich pipeline and elaborate instruction set and then
         wrote some small programs to play with it.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="page">
      <p>
         The source code for my x86 projects are unfortunately on a defunct hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
         One was a 3D renderer written for DOS, with the raster code written in x86
         assembly. Of course I wrote this on DOS, too, in edit.exe, to taste the authentic
         early 90s developer experience.
      </p>
      <p>
         Another project was a falling sand game, called FastSand,
         optimized with x86 assembly.

   <div class="page">

         The library targets both the GameBoy Advance and the Nintendo DS. Unfortunately due to
         strict licensing restrictions (you are not allowed to run code on the ARM7 co-processor,

         I had my fair share of fun making the Nintendo Entertainment
         System do very strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below is a video of SuperNSF, a crazy audio driver I wrote
         that has the ability to combine software-mixed PCM and NES
         hardware waveforms.

         The NES does not have hardware to time PCM playback. All it has
         is one register that you can manually feed a single sample to.
      </p>
      <p>
         For each block of code in the SuperNSF driver, I needed to keep
         track of the exact cycle count (yes, counting everything manually)
         so I could time the software mixer which outputs a single sample at
         a time.
      </p>
      <p>
         I used an array of dummy instructions to manually insert cycle delays
         and line everything up.
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="page">
      <p>
         I'm amazed that emulators even support it, as cycle-accuracy
         is required for proper execution. A funny quirk was that the pitch of
         the mixed output shifts slightly if you played channels at high frequencies.
         The memory page-crossing code was too complex to account for, so it made
         tiny delays in the output stream.

         I had been fascinated by music and sound drivers for a while,

         #mod_shrine regularly hosts one-hour music competitions, even

         The first month was spent designing and building
         <a href="https://github.com/mukunda-/snesmod/">SNESMOD</a>,
         an Impulse Tracker-based sound and music engine that rivals
         commercial legends. I used what I learned from making XMSNES
         (described below) and pushed the boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
         SNESMOD supports streaming PCM sounds from the SNES cartridge,
         all nightmarishly implemented
         on a <a href="https://mukunda.com/stuff/SPCTECH.html">500khz computer</a>.
         Tooling, documentation, and examples were all extremely limited
         or nil.

         The game had stickmen graphics all the way until the last week
         before the deadline, but
         <a href="https://twitter.com/codatrigger">@coda</a>
         pitched in and did some animation work while I worked on adding
         all of the levels in a complex map editor I built with Visual
         Basic.

      <h2>XMSNES</h2>
      <p>
         XMSNES is an XM module player for the Super Nintendo and the
         precursor to SNESMOD. What better way to get into SNES
         programming than writing the hardest things possible?
      </p>
   </div>
   <div class="page">
      <p>
         Similar to SNESMOD, XMSNES comes with a converter and sound
         driver that was split across the two processors in the SNES.
      </p>
      <p>
         Below shows a test demo of it, something that required me to
         rewrite a hardware cartridge hundreds of times (and stick it in the
         console, and boot it, and test via looking at those byte outputs onscreen)
         to track some of the bugs during development.
      </p>
      <p>
         The joys of programming, right?

         Some months later, Blizzard patched the game and incidentally removed the API Cross RP was
         depending on. They said that it was an unfortunate side effect, and introduced the
         Elixir of Tongues item to compensate, which essentially provides
         the same functionality of Cross RP, all without requiring an addon.

         I still had to rework my code to transfer role-play character profiles across the
         faction divide, basically doing the impossible. I'll spare you the details unless
         you ask, but I essentially built a peer-to-peer network and protocol, turning some
         of my userbase into routers to pass data where it needs to go.

      <h2>Other Modifications</h2>
      <p>
         I've written <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/tammymg/projects">multiple popular addons</a>
         that their users can't live without, as well as 
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/368v5i/mythiccool_weakauras/">a ton of other UI modifications</a>.
         I can really appreciate platforms and games that offer this
         flexibility for developers like myself.

         I was the #1 survival hunter in the world for a few days during
         Emerald Nightmare mythic progression. It was one of the hardest
         specializations to play, but I designed an 
         <a href="https://wago.io/4JarwDVg7">incredible UI</a> to
         trivialize it.
